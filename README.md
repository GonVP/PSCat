## Description
This repository is currently under active development as part of an ongoing PhD research about dust particles in protoplanetary disks.
Content, scripts, and documentation are being progressively updated and refined.

The data directory contains the catalog of simulations used in Vargas et al. (2025). It includes angle-resolved scattering matrices, absorption, scattering and extinction cross-sections, and single-scattering albedo for two particle families: consolidated porous particles modeled with ADDA and highly porous fractal aggregates modeled with MSTM. The catalog spans four (sub-)millimeter wavelengths and covers a broad range of porosities, size distributions, and two material compositions consistent with the optical properties adopted in the accompanying manuscript.

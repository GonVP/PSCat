## Description
This repository is currently under active development as part of an ongoing PhD research about dust particles in protoplanetary disks.
Content, scripts, and documentation are being progressively updated and refined.

The data directory contains the catalog of simulations described in Vargas et al. (2025). It includes angle-resolved scattering matrices, absorption, scattering and extinction cross-sections, and single-scattering albedo for two particle families: consolidated porous particles modeled with ADDA (Yurkin & Hoekstra, 2011) and highly porous fractal aggregates modeled with MSTM (Mackowski & Mishchenko 2011). The catalog spans four (sub)-millimeter wavelengths relevant for the analisis of observations of protoplanetary disks from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The catalog covers a broad range of porosities, using the DSHARP composition (Birnstiel et al. 2018) with and without the water-ice component.
